//a data type is a type of data :0 lmao how the computer interprets the data
//strings vs numbers are different
//statically typed = all data types upfront
//variables do not have types for dynamically typed 

//there are primitve types
//there are objects
//objects are an instance of a class, class is a data type
//boolean byte char int long float double are primitive types in java

//we create a primitive type in java
